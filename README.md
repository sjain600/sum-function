I am currently enrolled in the IBM Data Science Course.  I was currently learning about functions, and the lecturer was mentioning that there is coding behind the sum. 
Hearing that piqued my interest in building my own basic sum function. In the future, I am eager to learn more about other functions and what coding is behind them.
