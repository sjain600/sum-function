# Project Readme: Exploring Functions Through a Self-Migned Sum

Welcome! I have completed the IBM Data Science Course, where I explored various functions. The lecturer highlighted that there’s code behind even simple operations, such as summation, which sparked my interest in building my own basic sum function.

## Motivation
- Curiosity about how functions work under the hood
- Desire to implement and improve simple algorithms from first principles
- Aiming to apply the same mindset to more complex functions later

## Objectives
- Implement a basic sum function from scratch
- Experiment with variations (e.g., handling different input types, error checking)
- Document learnings and potential improvements for future functions

## Approach
1. Define the problem and expected behavior of the sum function
2. Write a straightforward implementation
3. Test with diverse inputs
4. Reflect on edge cases and potential optimizations
5. Extend to more functions as confidence grows

## Current Status
- In-progress learning phase within the IBM Data Science Course
- Initial focus on understanding the mechanics of functions
- Plan to iterate and enhance with real-world examples

## Future Enhancements
- Add input validation and error handling
- Support for different numeric types (integers, floats, decimals)
- Implement unit tests and automated test cases
- Explore recursion vs. iterative approaches
- Expand to other basic operations (difference, product, quotient)

## How to Run / Use
- Create a simple script or notebook to define and test the sum function
- Provide sample inputs and verify outputs
- Document any observations or surprising behavior for future reference
