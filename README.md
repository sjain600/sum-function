I am currently enrolled in the IBM Data Science Course.  I was currently learning about functions, and the lecturer was mentioning that there is coding behind the sum. 
Hearing that piqued my interest in building my own basic sum function. I am hoping to stay curious about other functions and improve them in my own ways.
